Hello World.

This is the first beta of the second version of D&D Dice Roller. For now I just added a more user-friendly interface and dice rolling.

This beta is very raw but I intend to add a lot more things in the future.

Currently the application is entirely in Portuguese but the final version will have support for English and other languages

Don't take anything from here into consideration for the final version, this is just the first beta of the program and there's still a lot to come, the program isn't even 20% ready so expect future updates on Github

My plans are to make an application to support D&D and other RPGs by making a completely Virtual Character Sheet where you have access to attribute rolls, inventory manipulation, life bar, dice rolls and other things that will help you at your tables both as a Player and Dungeon Master.

In the distant future I intend to release versions for IOS and Android when the application is ready.
